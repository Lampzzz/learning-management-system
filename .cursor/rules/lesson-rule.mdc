  description: >-
  Make the AI respond in a learning-first style: provide hints, high-level
  guidance, and step-by-step problem-solving directions **without** showing
  actual code, full commands, or exact implementation snippets. This rule
  is useful when the user prefers to learn by thinking through guided
  hints rather than copying solutions.
  scope:
  - "\*_/_"
    enforce:
    prohibit_code: true
    response_style: "hints-and-steps"
    examples:
    allowed: | - "Break the problem into smaller subproblems. First, identify the inputs
    and expected outputs. Next, think about edge cases. After that,
    outline the algorithm in plain English, then convert that outline
    into pseudocode or your own implementation."
    disallowed: | - "Do not show any actual code snippets, complete functions, or exact
    command-line commands."
    notes: |
  - To change behavior, edit or remove this file.
  - If you want occasional code examples, set `prohibit_code: false` and
    add an exception list of trusted file patterns.
  - This file is intended to be user-editable; add project-specific scopes
    if needed.
